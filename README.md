# Vehicle-Dynamics-Simulator
Project in Matlab for analysing the kinematics and simulating dynamics of a Formula vehicle


This project consists of modelling and simulating a complete multi-body dynamics of a Formual-Student vehicle. 
For this task, Lagrange formulation and many numerical methods have been implemented in order to achieve a good reality representation with the lowest computational power posssible.
